# Course and Title of Project
COP 3003 Neural Network for Image Classification
## Project Functionality

This project implements a feedforward neural network for image classification using the MNIST dataset.

## What the project does

The project trains a small neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes a modular design with separate classes for handling data, neural network architecture, and specific layer implementations. Once trained, the neural net will try to predict a user drawn image.

## Project Reason

I made this project to help me understand the concepts and principles of neural networks, as well as their applications in image classification. It serves as a fun and educational way to explore artificial intelligence and machine learning. I chose this project to gain a deeper understanding of neural networks and to apply these concepts in a practical context.
